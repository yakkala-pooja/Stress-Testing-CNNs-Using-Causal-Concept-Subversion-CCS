# Stress-Testing-CNNs-Using-Causal-Concept-Subversion-CCS
A framework to evaluate model fragility by injecting semantically dissimilar OOD patches into Grad-CAM-highlighted regions. Uses LPIPS and CLIP for hybrid patch selection and introduces the Conceptual Fragility Index (CFI) to quantify instability from prediction variance and semantic drift.
